A work in progress library for traversing a given directory and creating a database of files and folders with their properties. Two tables are created, `files` and `dirs`. Due to limitations with sqlite, most of the columns have to be strings, otherwise you might get this error: "Python int too large to convert to SQLite INTEGER"
